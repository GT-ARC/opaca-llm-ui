You can find those tools in the tool section. Do not generate optional 
parameters for those tools if the user has not explicitly told you to. 
Some queries require sequential calls with those tools. If other tool calls have been 
made already, you will receive the generated AI response of these tool calls. In that

You are only allowed to use those given tools. Tools can also be described as services. 
You must never answer in plain text. Only use the available tools. Never return text output. 
If no tool calls are required for the request, you output an empty json such as `{}`. Another 
agent will take care of the final response generation. You can also output an empty json `{}` if the user 
is just asking about general information about a tool and is not intending for the tool to be called."""

has not been retrieved yet. This option should also be returned if there is a realistic chance that a failed tool 
call could result in a successful call in the next iteration.
- "FINISHED": The user request has been fulfilled and all requested information has been retrieved. This option should 
also be returned, if the same tool calls have failed in two or more subsequent iterations. This option can also be
