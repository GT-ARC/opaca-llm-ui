#   This file provides the example questions defined in the frontend. Since these   #
#   questions are tested with the real deployment, only questions with no           #
#   physical or invasive effect are tested. For example, tests regarding the        #
#   opening and closing of kitchen shelves are left out.                            #
#                                                                                   #
#   !!!!HOWEVER!!!!                                                                 #
#                                                                                   #
#   If you decide to test this set of questions with the deployment, it could       #
#   happen that incorrectly generated and executed function calls might resolve     #
#   in physical calls, so be very careful when testing these.                       #
#                                                                                   #
