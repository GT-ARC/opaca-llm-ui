Note that this (https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-llm-ui/) is the public repository of the OPACA LLM UI project, but the main development work still happens in the internal/private repository at https://gitlab.dai-labor.de, including most (internal) tickets, development branches, merge requests, build pipelines, etc.

If you only have access to the Github repository, feel free to create issues if you have any suggestions, or improve things yourself with a fork and pull request. We will do our best to address or incorporate them in a timely manner.
